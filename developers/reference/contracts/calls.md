## Functions

### xcall

```solidity
function xcall(uint32 _destination, address _to, address _asset, address _delegate, uint256 _amount, uint256 _slippage, bytes _callData, uint256 _relayerFee) external payable returns (bytes32)
```

Initiates a cross-chain transfer of funds, calldata, and/or various named properties.

For ERC20 transfers, this contract must have approval to transfer the input (transacting) assets. The adopted assets will be swapped for their local (connext-flavored) asset counterparts (i.e. bridgeable tokens) via the configured AMM if necessary. In the event that the adopted assets _are_ local assets, no swap is needed. The local tokens will then be sent via the bridge router. If the local assets are representational for an asset on another chain, we will burn the tokens here. If the local assets are canonical (meaning that the adopted to local asset pairing is native to this chain), we will custody the tokens here.

#### Parameters

| Name           | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_destination` | `uint32`  | The destination chain's Domain ID (_not_ equivalent to “Chain ID”). See \[Domains] for details TODO                                                                                                                                                   |
| `_to`          | `address` | The target address on the destination chain. xcall will send funds to whatever address is specified here regardless of whether it is a contract or EOA. If calldata is provided, xcall will additionally attempt to call `xReceive` on this contract. |
| `_asset`       | `address` | The contract address of the asset to be bridged. If the `xcall` is calldata-only (e.g. doesn't bridge any funds), any registered asset can be used here as long as `amount: 0`.                                                                       |
| `_delegate`    | `address` | An address on destination domain that has rights to update slippage tolerance, retry transactions, or revert back to origin in the event that a transaction fails at the destination.                                                                 |
| `_amount`      | `uint256` | The amount of tokens to bridge specified in wei units (i.e. to send 1 USDC, a token with 10^6 decimals, you must specify the amount as `1000000`).                                                                                                    |
| `_slippage`    | `uint256` | The maximum slippage a user is willing to take, in BPS, due to the StableSwap Pool(s), if applicable. For example, to achieve 0.03% slippage tolerance this will be `3`.                                                                              |
| `_callData`    | `bytes`   | In the case of bridging funds only, this should be empty bytes ("0x"). If calldata is sent, then the encoded calldata must be passed here.                                                                                                            |
| `_relayerFee`  | `uint256` | (Optional) This is available in an overloaded `xcall`. If provided, the relayer fee will be taken in `_asset` rather than the native asset.                                                                                                           |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type    | Description                                                         |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \[0] | bytes32 | bytes32 - The transfer ID of the newly created crosschain transfer. |

### xcallIntoLocal

```solidity
function xcallIntoLocal(uint32 _destination, address _to, address _asset, address _delegate, uint256 _amount, uint256 _slippage, bytes _callData, uint256 _relayerFee) external payable returns (bytes32)
```

Helper function that xcalls as normal but forces the receipt of the local (Connext-flavored) asset at destination. This function is used typically to generate nextAssets that can be used to LP into the destination chain stableswap. Params and returned data function exactly the same way as `xcall`.

### execute

```solidity
function execute(struct ExecuteArgs _args) external returns (bytes32)
```

Called on a destination domain to disburse correct assets to end recipient and execute any included calldata.

_Can be called before or after `handle` \[reconcile] is called (regarding the same transfer), depending on whether the fast liquidity route (i.e. funds provided by routers) is being used for this transfer. As a result, executed calldata (including properties like `originSender`) may or may not be verified depending on whether the reconcile has been completed (i.e. the optimistic confirmation period has elapsed)._

#### Parameters

| Name   | Type               | Description              |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| \_args | struct ExecuteArgs | - ExecuteArgs arguments. |

#### Return Values

| ---- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \[0] | bytes32 | bytes32 - The transfer ID of the crosschain transfer. Should match the xcall's transfer ID in order for reconciliation to occur. |

### bumpTransfer (native asset)

function bumpTransfer(bytes32 _transferId) external payable
```

Anyone can call this function on the origin domain to increase the relayer fee for a transfer. MUST be called on the origin domain.

#### Parameters

| Name         | Type    | Description                                           |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| \_transferId | bytes32 | - The unique identifier of the crosschain transaction |

### bumpTransfer (transacting asset)

```solidity
function bumpTransfer(bytes32 _transferId, address _relayerFeeAsset, uint256 _relayerFee) external payable
```

Anyone can call this function to increase the relayer fee for a transfer (using the \_relayerFeeAsset specified). MUST be called on the origin domain.

**Parameters**

function forceUpdateSlippage(struct TransferInfo _params, uint256 _slippage) external
```

Allows a user-specified account (`delegate` in `xcall`) to update the slippage they are willing to take on destination transfers. MUST be called on the destination chain.

#### Parameters

| Name       | Type                | Description                               |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| \_params   | struct TransferInfo | TransferInfo associated with the transfer |

| \_originSender | address | Address of the contract or EOA that called `xcall` on the origin chain. NOTE: this param will _only_ be populated if the transaction went through the slow path rather than being executed immediately by a Connext router (see TODO for details) |
