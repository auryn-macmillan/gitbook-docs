# Ping Pong

`Ping` is a contract on some domain and `Pong` is a contract on some other domain. The user sends a ping and a pong will be sent back!

This example demonstrates how to use nested `xcall`s and a single direction emulating "callback" behavior.

## Ping Contract

The `Ping` contract contains an external `startPingPong` function that the user will call to initiate the flow. It _also_ implements `IXReceiver` because it will act as the "target" of an `xcall` from `Pong`. The `xReceive` function here is essentially a callback function - we can verify that something happened in `Pong`'s domain and handle any results passed back.

    pings++;
  }
}
```

## Pong Contract

`Pong` will send a nested `xcall` back to `Ping`, including some information that can be acted on.

    // Because this call is *not* authenticated, the _originSender will be the Zero Address
    // Ping's address was sent with the xcall so it can be decoded and used for the nested xcall
    (
      uint256 _pings, 
      address _pingContract, 
      uint256 _relayerFee
    ) = abi.decode(_callData, (uint256, address, uint256));
    
    pongs++;

    // This contract sends a nested xcall with the same relayerFee value used for Ping. That means
    // it must own at least that much in native gas to pay for the next xcall.
    require(
      address(this).balance >= _relayerFee,
      "Not enough gas to pay for relayer fee"
    );

    // The nested xcall
    sendPong(_origin, _pingContract, _relayerFee);
  }

  /** 
   * @notice This contract can receive gas to pay for nested xcall relayer fees.
   */
  receive() external payable {}
  
  fallback() external payable {}
}
```

An important note for `Pong` is that `sendPong` is _not_ `payable` and neither is `xReceive`. So in order for the 2nd `xcall` to work with `relayerFees`, the someone has to send native gas on destination to `Pong`. In practice, this can take the form of a "gas tank" mechanism that can be filled by users or subsidized by protocols.

Connext is working on an upgrade that will soon allow nested relayer fees to be deducted from the transacting asset, eliminating the need to fund receivers in their native gas token.
