# Requirements

The steps to set up your Connext xERC20 are very straightforward:

1. Choose a Home chain for your tokens (whatever chain your token is already deployed to!)
2. Deploy [Mintable/Burnable](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/xTokens) Token representations on the other chains you want to support.
3. Send your token addresses to the Connext Labs team to [register your token in our system](https://github.com/connext/monorepo/blob/75970ab3dc8c2e447c0099ef2d5fac2677749496/packages/deployments/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/TokenFacet.sol#L274).
4. Give the Connext contracts rights to mint your token.
5. Work with the team to signal to Connext routers to supply fast-liquidity for your token.

ðŸ’¡ It is entirely possible for you to run your own router to supply fast path liquidity in Connext if youâ€™d like! If this is prohibitively complex, however, we _**already**_ have an ecosystem of routers that can work with you to add liquidity for your token.

Routers are **highly** capital efficient (and earn money from fees), and so the network only needs about 1/8th of your expected 24h volume in liquidity in your token. Please contact us and we can help put you in touch with a router partner!

{% hint style="info" %}
You can expose bridging functionality to your users either through the [Connext Bridge](https://bridge.connext.network/) or by integrating directly into your projectâ€™s website/app. We recommend the latter because it makes your UX as smooth as possible! ðŸ˜„

And youâ€™re ready to go!
