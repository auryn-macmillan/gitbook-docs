# Spinning Up

### Checklist for Running a Router

* Spin up the router and configure for testnets.
* Provide liquidity and gas fees on testnets.
* Test the router on testnets.
* Change configuration to mainnets (use a different private key!), or spin up a new mainnet router.
* Provide liquidity on mainnets.
* Monitor router logs.

### Preparation

1. **Private key of your wallet** from Metamask.\
   For safety reason create a new wallet address for router. You can create it in Metamask extention or get it automatically during installation.\

2. **Setup provider endpoints.** You have to add it to `config.json` file to use your own endpoints. For that we will use the nodes provided by the service [Infura](https://infura.io/).

> You can use also [blastapi.io](https://blastapi.io) as RPC privider to get endpoints for almost any network ([the guide how to get it](https://medium.com/@alexzhurba/adding-rpcs-for-connext-36094191ae4f)). Many other RPC provider services exist as well.

2.1 Register at [infura.io](https://infura.io/) and create new project:

2.3 And copy your project ID. It will be the same on any network

**Keep this data handy, you will need it for further installation**
