# Architecture

The Connext protocol is composed of a set of smart contracts and offchain agents.

## Smart Contracts

Connext's smart contracts are the interfaces between the protocol and the wide gamut of different users in the ecosystem. There are contracts for handling `xcall`, managing asset registration, and provisioning liquidity for routers and stableswap LPs.

The full contract stack consists of the following components.

### Connext

Dispatches and handles messages related to sending funds across chains. Custodies funds for canonical assets, fast liquidity, and stable swaps.

The Connext contract uses the [Diamond](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) pattern so it comprises a set of Facets that act as logical boundaries for groups of functions. Facets share contract storage and can be upgraded separately.

<summary>Diamond Facets</summary>

#### TokenFacet

Manages asset enrollment, stores mappings of adopted <-> local assets, exposes liquidity caps functions, and specifies stableswaps for assets.

#### BridgeFacet

Implements `xcall` and enables destination-side calldata execution.

#### InboxFacet

Holds all the functionality needed for Connext's messaging layer to reconcile cross-chain transfers.

#### ProposedOwnableFacet

Provides a basic access control mechanism.

#### RelayerFacet

Manages whitelisting of relayers.

#### RoutersFacet

Manages whitelisting of routers and keeps track of router owners/recipients.

#### StableSwapFacet

A StableSwap implementation that custodies closely pegged assets (eg. group of stablecoins).

#### SwapAdminFacet

Manages only-admin controls for the StableSwapFacet.

#### DiamondCutFacet

Functions for adding, removing, and replacing facets.

#### DiamondLoupeFacet

Required by the Diamond standard. Implements the DiamondLoupe interface which allows for inspection of a Diamond contract's various facets and their functions.

### Messaging

The various contracts required to manage merkle roots containing hashed transfer data and send them through a hub-and-spoke architecture. The messaging architecture includes:

* **Connector.** A connector is an abstraction around an underlying transport layer. The `IConnector` interface requires a `processMessage` method implemented for handling incoming messages. `Connector` is an abstract contract that is inherited by the following contracts:
  * **SpokeConnector.** The `SpokeConnector` is deployed on spoke domains and implements a `send` method to send the Merkle root of all the messages that originate from the spoke domain to the hub domain. For example, `ArbitrumSpokeConnector` is deployed on the Arbitrum L2.
  * **HubConnector.** The `HubConnector` is deployed on hub domains for each spoke and implements a `sendMessage` method to send the aggregated Merkle root of all the received spoke Merkle roots to the configured destination domain. For example `ArbitrumHubConnector` is deployed on Ethereum L1.

Each AMB implementation requires us to create and deploy `HubConnector` and `SpokeConnector` contracts for that flavor of AMB, calling into the internal bridge infrastructure.

## Offchain Agents

### Routers

Routers are liquidity providers that enable instant liquidity for the user on the destination chain in return for a fee. Anybody can participate in the protocol as a router and there is no minimum liquidity required! Routers provide a crucial service to the Connext protocol.

Learn how to run one in the [Routers](broken-reference) section.

### Sequencer

The sequencer collects bids from all chains and randomly selects router(s) to fulfill them. Any number of routers can fulfill a single transaction, which is especially useful for large transfers. The sequencer will post batches of these bids to a relayer network to submit them to chain.

### Relayers

Relayers are a decentralized network of infrastructure operators that can execute smart contract transactions on behalf of a user in exchange for a small fee. Because the last leg of a cross-chain transaction requires execution on the destination domain, relayers play an important role in completing the full flow.

We are currently using [Gelato](https://www.gelato.network/) as our relayer service.
