### Roles and Responsibilities

The Security Council plays a critical role in safeguarding the Connext protocol, its DAO members, and the wider community. Its responsibilities include:

* Conducting critical maintenance, including software updates and configurations
* Taking emergency actions in potentially time-sensitive situations

The Security Council operates under the purview of the Connext DAO, which is responsible for holding membership elections.

### Election Process

Elections for the Security Council are held annually, excluding an initial 6-month bootstrapping phase, during which the Connext Foundation will appoint the initial council.&#x20;

Before each election cycle, the Connext DAO will open a one-month-long call for candidates, after which all eligible applicants will be put to a vote. The top 12 candidates will then be inducted into the council.

Changes to these elections may be proposed by the DAO, but not in an ongoing election cycle.

#### Criteria for Membership

To be considered for a position on the council, candidates must meet the following criteria:

* Garner support from at least 0.4% of the voting supply prior to the election.
* Maintain membership in the Connext DAO for at least 3 months prior to the election.
* Have no more than 3 representatives from the same organization on the Council at a given time.
* Publicly disclose any potential conflicts of interest prior to campaigning for membership.

#### Emergency Removals

Council membership can be revoked at any time outside of standard elections if 8 of the existing council members agree to removal. The Connext DAO can also remove council members through a two-thirds majority vote with a minimum participation of 6% of the token supply.

### Why have a Council?

While Connext aims to move towards ungovernance in the future, the Connext protocol is not currently ready to operate without a degree of administrative oversight in emergency and non-emergency situations. Electing a council allows the DAO to ensure they have representation at this level while allowing council members to gain experience operating the protocol.
